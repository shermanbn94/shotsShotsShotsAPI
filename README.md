# shotsShotsShotsAPI
Playing around with APIs and finding fun ways to implement all I've learned about JavaScript into creating interactive elements that actually feel usable.

My first introduction into the use of APIs. By connecting with and playing around with the public API the cocktail database. I used what I have learned about JavaScript so far to create a program that can search through the database for specific drinks as well as certain liquors. It responds with random drinks when you click the forward arrow and clicking the back arrow will show you the previous drinks you have clicked through. I have also programmed it to not show the same drink twice (which was surprisingly harder than I anticipated). Feeling very accomplished on this one.
